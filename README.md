## About Arkadius
It all began with an idea sparked by [ayo.so](https://ayo.so/), and we brought it to life. Users have the freedom to create their unique profiles, allowing for customization in areas such as color schemes, images, and the addition of links, among other features.

While the initial version of the application may not have been built using the latest and greatest technology, it remains functional, and we poured our hearts into its development. Although we haven't deployed it yet, our team is actively engaged in enhancing Arkadius. We are committed to creating a new iteration that leverages state-of-the-art architecture and technology.
